// 1. Write a program that checks if a variable is less than 10.
// If it is, alert the user that their variable is less than 10.
// If it is not, let the user know what the variable was and that it was greater than 10.
// 2.  Declare a function that takes a name as an argument and tells the user what name
// they've entered, try invoking it after it has been declared
// 3. Declare a function that takes no arguments but prints something to the console,
// try invoking it after it has been declared
// 4.  Create a `for` loop that "sings" the classic song "99 Bottles of Root Beer on the Wall".
// The code it outputs to the console should look similar to this:
// "99 bottles of root beer on the wall, 99 bottles of root beer...take one down,
// pass it around 98 bottles of root beer on the wall, 98 bottles of root beer on the wall,
// 98 bottles of root beer...take one down,
// pass it around 97 bottles of root beer on the wall," etc., all the way to 0 bottles.
